Freedom Cash Lenders Login

Earnin can advance you up to $750 from your next paycheck. You wonâ€™t have to pay any fees for the advance but Earnin does accept tips up to $14 per transaction.

While tipping might seem like a great way to show your gratitude for the free service, it can be surprisingly expensive. A $10 tip on a $500 cash advance that you pay back after two weeks is the equivalent of 52.14% APR.

Maximum amount: $750 per pay period
Fees: No mandatory fees or interest. Tips are optional. Lightning Speed transfers are available for $0.99 to $3.99
Speed: 1-3 business days
Repayment period: Your next payday
